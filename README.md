# ASL Classification Using Neural Networks

## Abstract
**Background:** In this research, we dive into the realm of American Sign Language (ASL) classification using neural networks. The primary objective is to develop machine learning models capable of recognizing and classifying ASL alphabets, thereby enhancing accessibility and inclusivity for the hearing-impaired community. We employ various neural network architectures, including Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), AlexNet, and ResNet34, each with its unique strengths and characteristics. The models are trained and evaluated using a curated ASL alphabet dataset obtained from Kaggle.

**Results:** After rigorous testing of our deep learning models in real-world scenarios, we have determined that the AlexNet model consistently achieves the highest accuracy in real-time ASL recognition. Leveraging the capabilities of AlexNet, we have successfully developed a robust and responsive system capable of providing instantaneous predictions of ASL letters in real-time.
