# ASL Classification Using Neural Networks

## Abstract

This research explores the application of neural networks for American Sign Language (ASL) classification. We developed and evaluated various neural network architectures, including Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), AlexNet, and ResNet34, to recognize and classify ASL alphabets. Our goal is to enhance accessibility and inclusivity for the hearing-impaired community through accurate ASL recognition.

## Key Findings

- Implemented and compared multiple neural network architectures for ASL classification
- Achieved high accuracy in real-time ASL recognition using the AlexNet model
- Developed a robust system for instantaneous predictions of ASL letters in real-time
